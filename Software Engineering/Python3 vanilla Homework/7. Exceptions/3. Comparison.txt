1. Exceptions
Exceptions are useful when we want to terminate our program when error occurs.
We don't want our code to continue executing with wrong data,
so we make it stop and tell us where and what the problem is.

2. Errors
"Try...Except" blocks or just printing out to the screen what the problem is,
is useful when we want to continue executing our code even with something wrong in it.
This method may be used when the error is about a part of the code, which does not affect the remaining code.
